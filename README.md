### About me

I'm the owner of 72 Services LLC and have been working as a software architect, developer, consultant, and trainer for 27 years, especially in the Java Enterprise environment.

My current interest is increasing the efficiency of full-stack development with Java. Due to my commitment to the Vaadin/Hilla environment, I received the Vaadin Community Award. I regularly share my knowledge in articles, speak at international conferences and write my own blog at https://martinelli.ch. 

Besides my work, I've been a lecturer at the Bern University of Applied Sciences for modern architecture and integrating distributed systems and persistence technologies with Java since 2007.
And I'm an expert group member of JSR-352 Java Batch and JSR-354 Money and Currency.
